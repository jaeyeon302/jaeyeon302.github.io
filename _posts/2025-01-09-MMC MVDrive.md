# Successful completion of 3-year university-industry collaboration project. 

My biggest university-industry project is finally finished!!

**For 3 years,**
Modular Multilevel Converter has been developed for variable frequency drive (VFD) application.

I have been developed entire control algorithms, including motor drive, balancing control, and current control.
It was a great journey to have had the invaluable guidance of professor [shenghui cui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shcui/) throughout this project.
This work is sponsored by Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering, HD Hyundai, and coworked with Kyungpook National University.
