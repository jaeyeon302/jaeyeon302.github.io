# Successful completion of 3-year MMC project. 

My biggest university-industry project is finally finished!!

**For 3 years,**
Modular Multilevel Converter has been developed for variable frequency drive (VFD) application.

I had developed control algorithms, including motor drive, balancing control, and current control.
It was a great journey to have had the invaluable guidance of professor [shenghui cui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shcui/) and [jae-jung jung](https://knuecslab.wixsite.com/knuecslab/professor) throughout this project.
In addition, I experienced the value of collaboration with my colleagues.
I truly felt appreciation for dongoon and seung-yong who have been through adversity together for 3 years.
This work is sponsored by Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering, HD Hyundai, and coworked with Kyungpook National University.
