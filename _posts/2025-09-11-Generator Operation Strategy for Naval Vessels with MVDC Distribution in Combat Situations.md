## Abstract
Naval vessels with an ac power systems typically operate two generators in parallel during navigation, following the N+1 redundancy policy, regardless of the load conditions. In combat scenarios, an additional generator is kept running at no load condition to ensure power availability in case of a failure of the operating generators. However, the optimal operating point of an internal combustion engine is approximately 85% of its rated capacity, and continuous low-load operation can lead to engine performance degradation, increased maintenance requirements, and reduced fuel efficiency. To address the operational and main-tenance challenges in generator management, this paper proposes a generator start-up strategy utilizing active front-end technology connected to the medium-voltage dc (MVDC) distribution. The proposed approach is expected to improve generator efficiency, mitigate engine wear, and reduce maintenance demands
