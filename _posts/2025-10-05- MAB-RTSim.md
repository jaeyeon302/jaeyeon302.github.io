## Abstract
Real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations of dual-active bridge (DAB) converters with high switching frequencies require a minimized time step to accurately capture input pulse patterns with high resolutions. However, reducing the time step poses challenges in solving the models while maintaining real-time constraints, particularly in multi-active bridge (MAB) converters, where the increased number of ports significantly escalates computational complexity compared to DAB converters. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a modular programming methodology for resource-efficient real-time simulation of MAB converters. The proposed approach partitions an MAB converter into multiple DAB converters, distributing computational workloads across processing units and enabling parallel execution. Using this divide-and-conquer strategy, the paper demonstrates real-time simulation of a quad-active bridge (QAB) converter with a time step of 250 ns.
