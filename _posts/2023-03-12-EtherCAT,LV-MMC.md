# Successful completion of my first university-industry collaboration project. 


Building an EtherCAT-based constrol system and LV MMC prototype from scratch was a challenging but worthwhile endeavor. It was a great journey to have had the invaluable guidance of professor [seung-ki sul](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TfmGd7AAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=sra), professor [shenghui cui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shcui/), and Dr. [sanggi ko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanggi-ko-30051880/) throughout this project. This work is sponsored by Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering, HD Hyundai, and coworked with Kyungpook National University.
